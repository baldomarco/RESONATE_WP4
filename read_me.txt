Here we are starting the experiment for WP4 in RESONATE where we implement the drought stress disturbance function and reduce the fertilization effect.

The starting date of the new experiment is 2024 08 06 where we modified the management scripts JS in the way to be readable in the new
iLand version 2.0. Only for the BAU management at the moment! hist - rcp45 rcp85 climate tables.

In the two R script we have the copy that you can find in the local github repository needed to be edit to tests the new results and tests.

Imp Reports:

20240806
In the folder 20240806 the names of the project files (xml) do not match with the name of the database... This was a starting mistake the management version (in this case BAU) is V10 so the project are the right name! In test13 we have the test of VPD function and without. We went for without due the too high disturbance impact.

Similarly in folder 20240807 is for wind version, once tried the V6 may be different the name of project file from the DB consider the version of the project file if different.

20240808 folder is for the coming back of the experiment and so to test 12! Where we are analysis the new managenet script coming from the changes in iland version 2.0 Here also refer to the project file name for the versions.

I replicated the analysis editing the CO2 beta coefficient to mitigate the fertilization effect and also using the iLand 2.0 Version. I recalculated the variable tables requested and added Shannon based on RU shannon calculation and then avg among the H index per RU.
