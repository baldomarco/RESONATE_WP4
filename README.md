This repository it is not complete. 

For the moment it is used to store partially of the data and the scripts used in the experiment realized for the Work Package 4 - Task 4.8 of the RESONATE H2020 project.

Management scripts development:

5 different management narratives Climate Change Adaptation, Business As Usual, 
Bioeconomy (production oriented), Conservation (increase protection), Unmanaged.

The first R scripts were needed to test the management algorithms. We run countless simulations to test and optimize all the required parameters to obtain a precise representation of our forest landscape (both in terms of management and in terms of forests ecological responses). It was important to evaluate if the developed management algorithms for the study (including many silviculture and management operations) were properly set and parametrised.

Tests, statistics, output visualization.

After that we created the former tables with the variables selected within the H2020 RESONATE framework and the analogues Case Studies.

(See edit #3,#4,#5) This passage was needed twice because we changed the CO2 fertilization effect into the project file to smooth and make realistic the forest growth specially for N. spruce dominated forests.

(See script #7). Here we created the script for analyse the resilience of the forest to disturbances events and impact on the forest stability (look into the #7 versions).

We developed a stability analysis framework to statistically analyze the forest resilience also under RCP4.5 and 8.5 with 4 different Regional Climate Models. The development of the final function is in progress.

The last and most recent section is dedicated at the analysis of another important index that is the part of the study:

The forest ecosystem multifunctionality and how the management strategies could drive it (see #8a,b).
